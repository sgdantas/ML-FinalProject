At the beginning, always pull

git fetch
git pull origin master


While you are working if you want to see what you have changed

git status

Once you are done working on something

git add -u
# This is to add already existing files (update)
git add -A
# This is to add a new file
git add name_file
# to add specific file

Then you commit 

git commit -m "comments on what you have "

and then 

git push origin master
# to push your changes
